# .: This file is managed by Puppet :.

default_voice_port=<%= @port %>
# UDP port open for clients to connect to.
# This port is used by the first    virtual server, subsequently started
# virtual servers will open on increasing    port numbers.   Default:
# The default voice port is 9987.

voice_ip=<%= @voice_ip %>
# IP on which the server instance will listen for
# incoming voice connections.   Default: The server is bound on any IP
# address.

create_default_virtualserver=<%= @create_default %>
# Normally one virtual server is
# created automatically when the TeamSpeak 3   Server process is
# started. To disable this behaviour, set this parameter   to "0". In
# this case you have to start virtual servers manually using the
# ServerQuery interface.   Default: If not provided, one virtual server
# is created.

machine_id=<%= @machine_id %>
# Optional name of this server process to
# identify a group of servers with   the same ID. This can be useful
# when running multiple TeamSpeak 3 Server   instances on the same
# database. Please note that we strongly recommend that   you do NOT run
# multiple server instances on the same SQLite database.   Default: The
# server instance will not use a machine ID.

filetransfer_port=<%= @filetransfer_port %>
# TCP Port opened for file transfers. If
# you specify this parameter, you also    need to specify the
# "filetransfer_ip" parameter!   Default: The default file tranfer port
# is 30033.
  
filetransfer_ip=<%= @filetransfer_ip %>
# IP on which the file transfers are bound
# to. If you specify this parameter,    you also need to specify the
# "filetransfer_port" parameter!   Default: File transfers are bound on
# any IP address.

query_port=<%= @query_port %>
# TCP Port opened for ServerQuery connections. If
# you specify this parameter,    need to specify the "query_ip"
# parameter!   Default: The default ServerQuery port is 10011.

query_ip=<%= @query_ip %>
# IP bound for incoming ServerQuery connections.
# If you specify this parameter,    you also need to specify the
# "query_port" parameter!   Default: ServerQuery connections are bound
# on any IP address.

clear_database=<%= @clear_database %>
# If set to "1", the server database will be
# cleared before starting up the server.    This is mainly used for
# testing. Usually this parameter should not be specified,    so all
# server settings will be restored when the server process is restarted.
# Default: Database is not cleared on start.

logpath=<%= @logpath %>
# The physical path where the server will create
# logfiles.   Default: The server will create logfiles in the "logs/"
# subdirectory.

dbplugin=<%= @dbplugin %>
# Name of the database plugin library used
# by the server instance. For example, if   you want to start the server
# with MySQL support, simply set this parameter to   "ts3db_mysql" to
# use the MySQL plugin. Do *NOT* specify the "lib" prefix or the file
# extension of the plugin.   Default: The default SQLite3 database
# plugin will be used.
  
dbpluginparameter=<%= @dbpluginparameter %>
# A custom parameter passed to the
# database plugin library. For example, the MySQL   database plugin
# supports a parameter to specify the physical path of the plugins
# configuration file.   Default: The database plugin will be used
# without a parameter.

dbsqlpath=<%= @dbsqlpath %>
# The physical path where your SQL script files are
# located.   Default: The server will search for SQL script files in the
# "sql/" subdirectory.

dbsqlcreatepath=<%= @dbsqlcreatepath %>
# The physical path where your SQL
# installation files are located. Note that this    path will be added
# to the value of the "dbsqlpath" parameter.   Default: The server will
# search for SQL installation scripts files in the
# "<dbsqlpath>/dbsqlcreatepath/" subdirectory.
  
licensepath=<%= @licensepath %>
# The physical path where your license file is
# located.   Default: The license file is located in your servers
# installation directory.
  
query_ip_whitelist=<%= @query_ip_whitelist %>
# The file containing
# whitelisted IP addresses for the ServerQuery interface. All hosts
# listed in this file will be ignored by the ServerQuery flood
# protection.   Default: The whitelist file is located in your servers
# installation directory.
  
query_ip_backlist=<%= @query_ip_backlist %>
# The file containing
# backlisted IP addresses for the ServerQuery interface. All hosts
# listed in this file are not allowed to connect to the ServerQuery
# interface.   Default: The whitelist file is located in your servers
# installation directory.

dbclientkeepdays=<%= @dbclientkeepdays %>
# Defines how many days to keep unused client
# identities. Auto-pruning is triggered on every    start and on every
# new month while the server is running.   Default: The server will
# auto-prune client identities older than 90 days.
  
dblogkeepdays=<%= @dblogkeepdays %>
# Defines how many days to keep database log
# entries. Auto-pruning is triggered on every    start and on every new
# month while the server is running.   Default: The server will auto-
# prune log entries older than 90 days.
  
logquerycommands=<%= @logquerycommands %>
# If set to "1", the server will log every
# ServerQuery command executed by clients. This can   be useful while
# trying to diagnose several different issues.   Default: ServerQuery
# commands will not be logged.
  
no_permission_update=<%= @no_permission_update %>
# If set to "1", new permissions will not
# be added to existing groups automatically. Note that   this can break
# your server configuration if you dont update them manually.   Default:
# New permissions will be added to existing groups automatically.
  
dbconnections=<%= @dbconnections %>
# The number of database connections used by the
# server. Please note that changing this value   can have an affect on
# your servers performance. Possible values are 2-100.   Default: The
# server will use 10 database connections.
  
logappend=<%= @logappend %>
# If set to "1", the server will not create a new
# logfile on every start. Instead, the log   output will be appended to
# the previous logfile. The logfile name will only contain the   ID of
# the virtual server.   Default: The server will create a new logfile on
# every start.
